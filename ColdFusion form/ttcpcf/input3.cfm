Responsibilities<br><br>NASA Hosts and Sponsors should be aware that the exporting of certain information technology, equipment and software is subject to Federal regulations. <b> Should a Host or Sponsor have any questions reference the exporting of a technology, they are responsible for contacting the  Center Export Control Administrator for clarification or determination prior to release.</b>   An Export is a release of commodity, technology, or software to a FN in this country or abroad.    An export to a FN in this country is deemed an export to the home country of the FN. <br><br>B. Regulations<br><br>Export Administration Regulations (EAR) [15 CFR 730-774] are administered by the Commerce Department under the authority granted by the Export Administration Act of 1979 as amended.  Information not controlled under the ITAR shall be controlled by the Commerce Department.    The counterpart to the United States Munitions List (USML) of the State Department's ITAR is     the Commerce Control List (CCL) of the Commerce Department's EAR.  <br><br>Foreign National Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR [22 CFR 120 - 130]) and Section 38 of theArms Export Control Act (22 USC 2778) authorizes the President of the United States to controlthe export and import of defense articles. The Presidential authority to promulgate regulations with respect to the export and import of defense articles was delegated to the Secretary of State  by Executive Order 11958. The ITAR implements this delegated authority.<br><br>There are both substantial criminal and civil penalties for violations of ITAR and EAR. Acriminal conviction could lead to fines of up to $1M and 10 years imprisonment for each violation. In addition, an individual violator could incur civil penalties of up to $100,000. Also  NASA could lose its export privilege. <br><br>C. Examples of Commodities Controlled by the CCL <br><br>While the State Department specifies general items that are controlled (e.g., certain remote sensing satellites), the Commerce Department specifies controlled thresholds for each  commodity.  The following are examples of CCL directly from the Commerce Department   regulations.  This is just one example from the approximate four hundred pages of commodities    and specifications listed under the CCL. Each commodity then lists specific controls for those     specifications which would apply to certain countries for certain policy reasons (e.g.,      antiterrorism, missile technology, national security, regional stability, etc.). <br><br>1.

Contacts can be found at   http://itcd.gsfc.nasa.gov/ITCD-LNFiles/GSFC-Security-Officials.html. <br><br>2.    At the top, fill in the full name of the Foreign National (FN) and the name of the program orproject they are supporting, exactly the same as in the front of the TTCP and the other appendices.  Do the same in the first paragraph.<br><br>3.    For the signature page, the name of the current Goddard Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) can be found at http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/CIO/contact/index.html <br><br>4.    Use the check boxes to identify all NASA IT resources the FN will need to access to.  Check all IT System boxes that apply - this will probably be more than just one.<br>a.    Consult with your ISSO if you are unsure of what information system covers the computer the FN will be using.  The information system titled "SED Multi-Program/Project IT Science  System (SED MPP ISS), CD-014-L-GSF-6004" is the Code 600 "umbrella" IT system   covering the bulk of the Directorate's scientific systems; this information system does NOT    include NCCS, VLBI, GES DISC, SOHO/SDAC, PPS/GPM or GISS. <br>b.    Information Systems Owner (ISO) Signatures for commonly accessed Code 400 and 600 systems have already been attained as Attachments A and B of this Appendix.<br>c.    If the FN needs access to an information system managed by another directorate, use Attachment C to fill in the information about the information System covering that computer  - the information system name, the information system security plan number, the   implemented controls (get these from the system ISSO), and have the ISO sign next to the    information.  The ISO will be signing for concurrence on the status of implemented controls     and foreign national access to the information system.<br>d.    If the information system is a NASA external system, the NASA Authorizing Official will sign for concurrence on the status of implemented controls and foreign national access to the external information system.  <br>e.    Attachment D must be completed for FNs from the following sub-set of designated countries: China, Burma, Eritrea, Iran, North Korea, Saudi Arabia, and Sudan. <br>f.    Check all applicable boxes in the Computer Access Method section.  Personally owned computers cannot be connected to the CNE nor can they be used to extend the NASA  network to the computer via VPN technology.<br><br>  5.
